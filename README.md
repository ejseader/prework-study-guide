# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
- This project was built as a place to organize my notes about each section of the prework curriculum
- It solves the problem of having disorganized notes and gets me used to the Git Workflow
- I already had a foundation in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but was not yet comfortable with Git. I have learned a lot more about the Git Workflow.
